# AI
In this repository I have published my solutions of the DT3017 Artificial Intelligence course labs at Dalarna University.

## Course information

### Learning Outcomes
After a basic discussion of the various definitions of Artificial Intelligence (AI) the students should gain insights into the various technical and philosophical issues involved in AI. Upon completion of the course, the students should be able to:

- Apply artificial intelligence to relevant problems through the use and further development of modern software tools
- Conduct a comparative analysis, both theoretical and empirical, in order to decide which AI paradigm is most suitable for a particular task
- Read an article in the field, understand it and make a critical analysis
- Explain both the advantages and limitations of solutions based on artificial intelligence to people without deep technical knowledge
- Build a simpler AI system on their own and evaluate its performance
- Conduct research in artificial intelligence in a technically and ethically sound manner

### Course Content
The course first gives a historical and philosophical introduction to AI and then a more practical overview. Digital representation and manipulation of knowledge are central themes and are covered in detail.
Difficulties such as combinatorial explosions and infinite search trees which are encountered in knowledge modeling illustrate the need for intelligent algorithms. Complex search spaces and search methods are covered in the context of problem-solving. Additional AI paradigms which give additional possible methods are introduced; neural networks which are used for prediction and classification and genetic algorithms which are used for stochastic optimisation. Finally hybrid intelligent systems and practical applications of AI are discussed.

### Assessment
Laboratory reports – 1.5 HEC’s (U-G), Project work – 1.5 HEC’s (U-G), Mandatory lectures and Written examination – 4.5 HEC’s (U-3-4-5).

### Forms of Study
The student acquires knowledge during lectures, labs, technical article presentations and project work in groups. The student is also supposed to study individually.
